# Digital-Weather-Rock
Digital Weather Rock for BMP280/AS3935 
This is an Arduino project for the Heltec Lora/ESP32 - basically breadboard #3 
I build most of my code in Visual studio and then copy paste back and forth - the 
Power point explains how I used an arduino board to prototype the 
individual boards then I integrtaed iton the Heltec 
I put the comment sections from the code I used from other authors
they should get all the credit .. I'll take the blame.
code is not finished but functions well enough as a prototype
feel free to use the code and embelish 
don't critizize my programming - I'm an Engineer not a Programmer Dammit!
wiring diagrams are rudementry I'll go back and update the PDF later..
case is a smart phone case
yes display is small -I have a 2" dial display but there is only so much time and
I'm trying to take over the world in my spare time..
I've yet to figure out how to monitiize taking over the world so 
there's work... got to make money somehow,
and family, sleep , eat, other things I got to do..
